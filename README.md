## Work Experience 💼

In my previous roles, I've had the pleasure of working with some remarkable teams. Currently, I'm rocking the Node.js world as a developer, crafting AWS Lambda functions and diving into the depths of PostgreSQL. I've even sprinkled some magic into the mix with PostgreSQL's full-text search, taking search functionality to new heights. Prior to that, I worked my coding magic as a Developer at TCS Quartz Compliance, where I danced with Node.js and Kafka, conjuring up real-time microservices that brought harmony to different systems. 💻🔮
